I am currently working with Dr. Abhishek Gupta, and [CAR](https://car.osu.edu/) for developing a software to simulate "connected and autonomous urban traffic". The software is aimed at providing an environment to enable intelligent transportation systems researchers interface their research with modern machine learning frameworks.
